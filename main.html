                <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2> 
                <p>Climate change refers to shifts in the Earth’s climate patterns at local, regional, or global levels, including their effects. In recent history, the term has been closely associated with human-driven changes, starting from the pre-Industrial era (around 1850). Activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused a rapid rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, leading to significant changes in the Earth's climate. Global warming is often used as a synonym for climate change but specifically focuses on the increase in average global temperatures. This warming has widespread impacts on humans, animals, and ecosystems. However, climate change encompasses more than just temperature rise, including other environmental changes. Scientists widely agree—97% of active climate researchers—that human actions have been the main driver of warming since the 20th century. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have surged from about 280 parts per million (ppm) in the pre-Industrial period to 413 ppm by 2020. This level is unmatched in recorded history. To mitigate global warming, scientists emphasize the need to bring carbon dioxide concentrations back to a safer level of 350 ppm by 2100.</p>

                        <h2>Taking Action Against Climate Change</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Climate change is a major problem, but there are many ways we can help solve it. Protecting the environment and reducing harmful emissions are essential steps. One way to contribute is by restoring ecosystems like mangroves, which are vital in fighting climate change. Mangroves absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide, protect communities from storms and floods, and provide homes for many animals.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Another important step is educating students about climate change and the actions they can take. Schools can include lessons on reducing waste, saving energy, and protecting nature. Hands-on activities, like tree planting and recycling programs, help children and young people understand their role in protecting the planet.</p>
                        
                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Participating in coastal cleanup drives is also a simple yet impactful way to make a difference. Removing trash from beaches and coastal areas prevents pollution from harming marine life and keeps our ecosystems healthy. These activities also bring people together, raising awareness about how our actions affect the environment.</p>
                        
                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">By working together—restoring nature, educating future generations, and participating in community activities like cleanups—we can take meaningful steps toward solving climate change and creating a healthier planet for everyone.</p>

                                <h2>What Is the Main Cause of Climate Change?</h2>
                                 <p>The main cause of climate change is human activities. By burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for energy, we release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Deforestation, industrial processes, and waste production also contribute to this problem. These actions increase the heat trapped in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and changing the planet's climate.</p>
